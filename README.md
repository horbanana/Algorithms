# Algorithms

Random algorithms and data structures implemented in Javascript, just for fun. Exploring different coding styles, so the coding style might differ greatly between files.

Ideas / todo:

- Stack - array based, unbounded
- Queue - array based, unbounded
- Deque - list based
- Queue - based on two stacks
- Heap
- Set
- Disjoint Set/UnionFind
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph and Graph algorithms
- Hash Table
- Bloom Filter
